          <p class="leading-relaxed text-sm">
            We retain your personal information for as long as your account is active. If you delete your account, we will delete your personal data within 30 days, except where we are required by law to retain it for a longer period. Anonymized, aggregated data (e.g., total tasks completed across the platform) may be retained indefinitely as it cannot identify you.

          <p class="leading-relaxed text-sm">
            We take security seriously. Your data is encrypted in transit (TLS) and at rest. We use Supabase's row-level security to ensure users can only access their own data. Passwords are hashed using bcrypt and never stored in plain text. That said, no system is 100% secure — if you suspect unauthorized access to your account, contact us immediately at <a href="mailto:privacy@tidyapp.me" class="text-primary-600 underline">privacy@tidyapp.me</a>.

          <p class="leading-relaxed text-sm">
            Tidy is not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. The Family plan allows household members to manage tasks together, but account creation requires users to be 13 or older. If you believe a child under 13 has created an account, please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@tidyapp.me" class="text-primary-600 underline">privacy@tidyapp.me</a> and we will delete the account promptly.
